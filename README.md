  ### Installation ###
  To create your own burger logger you must clone the repo and install the required dependencies. The current dependencies are MySQL, Node, EXPRESS, and EXPRESS-HANDLEBARS. Once the repo is cloned and the dependencies are installed; the user must update their credentials in the connect.js file in order to connect to their database. Alternatively, you can simply navigate to the website [BURGERTOWN](https://mighty-harbor-00350.herokuapp.com/) where the application is live!
      
      
  ### Usage ###
  From the live BurgerTown page the user has several options:
  1 - Name and add a new burger.
  2 - Trash a burger (deleting it from the db).
  3 - They can devour a burger
  4 - They can recook a burger that has been devoured.
  5 - Lastly, when adding a burger they get to choose if it has already been devoured.
